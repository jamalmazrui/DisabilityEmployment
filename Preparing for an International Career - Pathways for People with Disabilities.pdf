A
t age 19 Andrea Shettle, who
is Deaf and also has attention
deficit disorder, read a World
Federation of the Deaf report about
the widespread lack of access to
education and employment for Deaf
people in other countries. Almost
fifteen years later, this realization
would eventually lead Andrea to a
position at the World Bank.
When asked, "What do you want
to do with your future?" few
young adults who are Deaf or
have disabilities think to say, "An
international career." Yet there is a
whole world of opportunities open in
the international affairs, exchange
and development fields. This can
include working in U.S. embassies
overseas or the U.S. Department of
State in Washington, DC. It can mean
working in an international consulting
firm, college or university study
abroad office or international refugee
organization in the United States or
abroad.
For Andrea, her career took a
roundabout path. "My problem was
that I had no clue how on earth I
could get involved," she says of her
college years. "I had zero contacts
in the international community at
that point. I had never heard that
there was a field called `international
development' that so perfectly
captured the kind of work I wanted
to do, even though I had not yet
narrowed down my interests to a
more specific sphere of tasks."
This booklet intends to direct young
adults with international interests
in the right direction from the start.
Many pathways exist for fulfilling
international career aspirations, and
this publication will help in exploring
some of the possibilities. It highlights
different types of international
occupations, tips to prepare for an
international career, insights from role
models and emerging leaders with
disabilities in these fields, and the
international exchange and fellowship
programs they participated in to get
them where they are today.
Thank you to the Bureau of
Educational and Cultural Affairs of the
United States Department of State for
sponsoring the National Clearinghouse
on Disability and Exchange (NCDE),

USA (MIUSA), and this booklet.

International Careers

7
C
areers in the international
field offer a chance to work in
a variety of settings and with
a diversity of people. Some of the
questions to consider include:
Do I want to relocate overseas and
work directly with people in those
communities?
Do I want to work in the United
States administering international
programs?
Am I interested in working with:
 The federal government or
public entity
 A non-profit agency
 Private business or consulting firm
 International organization, or
 Educational institution?
For a detailed resource on various
career options in the international
field, consult Careers in International
Affairs, Seventh Edition, edited
by Maria Pinto Carland and Lisa
Gihring at the School for Foreign
Service, Georgetown University
Press, Washington, DC (2003).
It includes tips on job searching,
interviewing and finding a mentor
as well as separate chapters on
what to expect when working with
the U.S. government, international
development, nonprofit, and
educational organizations, or
in banking, business, lobbying,
consulting, media and research.
PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES
WORKING IN THE INTERNATIONAL
FIELD
The following are stories about people
with disabilities of all backgrounds and
ages who hold positions in the fields
of international affairs, exchange and
development.
Other internationally oriented
professions in which people with
disabilities are working, but not
specifically discussed in this booklet,
include those such as international
business, trade, finance, health,
journalism and law.
International Careers:
TypesofCareerOptions
"I'm wide open about what I want to do. I could volunteer in Africa with
kids, work at an embassy or mentor kids with disabilities in the United
States about international issues. I either want to work internationally
or in Washington, DC. I want to explore it. I have a lot to offer."
Alison LePage, learning disability,
student in Political Science at Western Michigan State University

MICHELE SHORESMAN
Position: Assistant Dean for
Graduate and Joint Degree Programs
at Washington University School of
Law, Missouri
 Works with international students
in the law school and supports law
students studying abroad.
 Travels to European recruitment
fairs or recruits international
students online.
 Formerly advised students in the
University's study abroad office
and on Fulbright programs.
"It's a great field for people with
disabilities [that affect mobility] since
all day I'm sitting and counseling
students, working on a computer,
talking to prospective students,
writing and reading. It's the nature
of the job. You're also out there with
students from all over the world and
they teach you about their cultures."
Disability: Multiple sclerosis
"Five years ago with the onset of
MS, I changed my job, changed
my car, and changed my house to
make adaptations." The dean at her
new position has been supportive
of Shoresman by arranging a
designated parking space in front of
the building and providing an office
on the first floor. "He made my life [at
work] easy because he values what I
do, and I really enjoy this new job."
Travel Opportunities
Michele traveled to Germany for three
weeks on a Fulbright International
Education Administrators seminar
to visit college and university
campuses; meet with government
officials involved with education; and
experience Germany's culture.
"No one should count himself or
herself out. Be willing to allow others
to help and you will get the most out
of your experience."
INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGE
Professionals in this field provide recruiting and administrative support for
programs that send people abroad or bring them from other countries to the
United States to study, intern, volunteer, teach, conduct research, or do
short-term professional work. It is part of the international education
field, which seeks to promote more global awareness and intercultural
communication skills among the high school, college or general populations.

ELISE READ
Position: Former Regional Assistant
Director, Arcadia University Center for
Education Abroad, Colorado
 Represented the Center's seventy
education abroad programs in ten
different countries.
 Built relationships with U.S. study
abroad advisors about the
Center's programs.
 Communicated with the Center's
overseas directors about enrolled
students' questions.
"For a few years, I traveled across
the Rocky Mountain region as a
program representative, advising
college students of the many
benefits of studying abroad. At the
same time, I encouraged students
with disabilities and chronic health
conditions to consider their options
for overseas study by volunteering to
talk with them through such avenues
as the National Clearinghouse on
Disability and Exchange's Peer-to-
Peer Network."
Disability: Type I diabetes
When in college, Elise studied abroad
in China on a National Security
Education Program fellowship.
"I encourage anyone considering
studying or living abroad to not let a
disability or chronic condition stand in
the way. With adequate preparation
and support from doctors, family,
friends, and advisors, studying
abroad and working in this field can
indeed become a reality and bring as
many positive changes to your life as
they have to mine."
Travel Opportunities
Elise spent at least 100 days per
year on the road in the United States,
attending study abroad fairs at
universities, conferences, orientation
sessions or meetings with students,
study abroad advisors and faculty
members. Traveling was light in
the summer, which allowed time to
develop special projects. Twice a year
she traveled to Arcadia University in
Pennsylvania to meet with the rest of
the staff.
"It was great to be able to work
independently from home, and
plan your own schedule. They really
treated us well and trusted us. I
traveled more than required, but had
flexibility during less busy times."

CAROL DOEZAL
Position: Office Management
Specialist, Bureau of Human
Resources, the U.S. Department of
State, Washington, DC
A wide variety of postions exist for
someone in the international affairs
field.
"In my first job, I worked for a
big sugar company in England.
They needed somebody who was
bilingual in English and French. The
government of Cameroon contracted
with the company to do a feasibility
study to determine if we could grow
sugar cane up in the arid northern
part of the country. I was hired by
this company to go to Cameroon, set
up an office and assist the engineers
to get established."
"The first time I was hired for a job
here in the United States I was
actually overseas working at the
American International Commerce
Center in Milan, Italy. I was speaking
with the CEO of one of the companies
that had come to exhibit their
products, and he offered me a job
as an executive assistant in New
York. Eventually, I applied both for
the Foreign Service and for jobs
at other government agencies. I
was hired by the United States
Information Agency (USIA), which was
the international educational, cultural
and informational side of the federal
government, and has now been
integrated into the U.S. Department
of State. I worked for USIA for about
two years. The Foreign Service finally
called and offered me a job. I was
anxious to get back overseas and so
that's what I did back in 1985.
INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS
Professionals in this field are involved primarily in public service to forge
international relations through diplomacy and foreign affairs, information
sharing, and global cooperation on world issues. They support efforts to
create international alliances on issues that affect all countries, such as
air pollution or human rights, and to create mutually beneficial agreements
between countries such as for trade or immigration purposes.
11
"You need to be knowledgeable in
certain fields in order to do some
foreign service jobs. Although some
of it may be routine such as office
management type of work. In my last
job I worked in the protocol office for
three years. It was really important
that you had an international
background and experience overseas
to know how to understand certain
cultural issues.
"I am an office management
specialist in my current position with
the Foreign Service grievance board
of the U.S. Department of State. This
is not a conventional office in that
sense. We are like an appeals office
where people come who've been
suspended or put on leave without
pay for misconduct or have received
an evaluation that they think is unfair.
We review the appeal and make
decisions on it."
Disability: Vision disability
"I've lost about 95% of my sight and
yet I don't fit in any category. I don't
fit in the world of the blind, and I
don't fit in the world of the sighted."
As her eyesight has changed over
her twenty-year career in the Foreign
Service, so has access. For example,
the United States Department of
State has updated its computer
software, which makes it easier
to access the computers than
previously.
Travel Opportunities
"I grew up in the diplomatic service.
My dad was in the Foreign Service,
and I really enjoyed the travel part of
it. When I reached high school level,
we were evacuated out of Africa to the
United States because a war broke
out. My first introduction to American
education was in my freshman year
in high school. I did my junior college
year abroad in Rome.
"What I've enjoyed have been
interesting places like Africa,
because you get such a diverse
mix of people there. I meet [people
from] so many different cultures
­ Dutch people, French people,
Belgians ­ that's what I've enjoyed
the most. Also getting to know the
local culture, the local areas, the
markets and the travel. Sometimes
it's been wonderful, sometimes it's
been difficult depending on what
country I've been in, but overall all I
think there's always a positive aspect
to everything, no matter where you
go. You meet the most incredible,
interesting people."

INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS
CHRIS EMANUEL
Position: Program Analyst, Climate
Change Division, U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency, Washington, DC
"[For] my first job, I worked with
the Fulbright program as a Senior
Program Associate. I worked with
the visiting scholars and the scholar
enrichment program. We brought
professors from all over the world
to the United States and placed
them in different U.S. colleges and
universities. We were responsible for
them and their families ­ everything
they needed while they were
on assignment, usually for one
academic year. We got to know them
pretty well. Every spring we had a
huge conference where we would
invite these visiting scholars to
Washington, DC ­ that was exciting
because then I could put faces to the
names.
"Currently, I work with the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency
working on methane issues. We meet
with a lot of global organizations to
see if we can help to stem the tide of
global warming or climate change."
Disability: Wheelchair user
"In my first job, most of the year I
spoke on the phone and the Fulbright
scholars were not even aware that I
was in a wheelchair. So by the time
they saw that I was in a wheelchair,
they were surprised, but we already
knew each other. In addition to the
seminars the scholars participated
in while they were in Washington,
DC, we built in time for sightseeing
around the city. In doing so, they
became aware of certain barriers,
like stairs, and the certain ways
a person in a wheelchair has to
maneuver. A lot of times people
would be talking to me and they'd
forget I am in a wheelchair, so when
we come to a flight of stairs, they say
`Come on!' and then `Oh, I forgot.'
"The positive challenge is to educate
and make people aware. Just by
your presence, people are watching
you. Sometimes when you go abroad
there are the physical barriers, and
places aren't as accessible as in the
United States. But that is a learning
experience as well. I have challenges,
but you have to have confidence in
yourself and your purpose, and then
when people see you and see your
resolve, that's when the education
begins. That's when they really start
to see you for you."
Travel Opportunities
"My major was International
Relations at the University of
Southern California. My family is
originally from Panama and Jamaica,
so I have been interested in
international topics since birth. My
stepfather was in the Marine Corps
so we traveled a lot.
"In my current position I travel often
to China and India, meeting with
global organizations."
13
ALISON HILLMAN
Position: Director of Mental
Disability Rights International's
Americas Advocacy Initiative,
Washington, DC
Alison works for international
recognition and enforcement of the
rights of people with psychiatric
disabilities.
"The positive aspects of my work with
Mental Disability Rights International
are being able to travel, use my
Spanish, and being able to see
changes that are taking place in
other countries. It is really exciting to
see things that are going on in other
parts of the world. Colleagues are
so far away that sometimes keeping
up on what's going on in a country,
cultural differences and coordinating
a team from all different types of
backgrounds can be a challenge.
"I went to college at Cornell, and
earned a degree in Government
with a concentration in U.S.-Latin
American Relations. Upon graduation
I wanted to go to Latin America and
see for myself what the long-term
impacts of U.S. policies were. So that
was my first experience and that led
me to want to do international work."
Disability: Bi-polar disorder
"I wasn't diagnosed nor did I have
symptoms until I was 26 or 27. Only
after this road to recovery, graduating
from law school and learning about
Mental Disability Rights International,
did I decide to incorporate all of
these passions for international
human rights work, disability and
working in Latin America.
"My current boss is my mentor.
There have been many less formal
mentors along the way. Specifically,
women with psychiatric disabilities
have been tremendously inspiring
and empowering for me ­ really
powerful women who didn't let
psychiatric disabilities get in the way.
If fact, they draw strength from their
experiences."
INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT
Professionals in this field work to improve the lives of people worldwide,
working in areas such as agriculture, education, health, human rights, poverty
reduction, transportation and refugee issues. International development
professionals provide technical and resource assistance for countries to
develop their communities, or relief aid to people in times of crisis or war.
14
Travel Opportunities
"During the summer between the
first and second years of law school,
I designed a research project in the
Peten, an area in Guatemala. It was
a study on the effects of petroleum
exploitation in the Mayan reserve
on the indigenous populations
and the environment. At American
University International Human Rights
Law Clinic, we had a case where I
went to Panama for a week and did
investigation and client-centered
assistance."
In her current position, Alison has
traveled to countries such as Peru
to investigate abuses in psychiatric
hospitals, address human rights and
disability legislation, and organize
workshops and support groups for
psychiatric survivors.
INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT
JYOTI VIDHANI
Position: Material Resources Officer
at Catholic Relief Services (CRS), a
U.S. based international development
and relief agency, Gujarat, India.
"I prepare reports, monitor and
evaluate the food aid programs run
by our partners, and present an
accurate picture of the CRS activities
undertaken in my region to the main
head office located at New Delhi.
"They mostly run food aid programs
and also some projects on HIV/AIDS,
women empowerment and peace
building that target people directly
from lower economic classes and
minority communities, mostly residing
in remote rural areas. Working with
them certainly has enhanced my
knowledge and skills as to how
similar strategies can be applied to
create better living conditions for
disabled people.
"Working with CRS, I am getting
an opportunity to work with more
organized and experienced staff,
who have well-defined models and
mechanisms laid down to work at
the grassroots level. I am becoming
more knowledgeable, more aware
of the grave situations of the poor
and needy people in the nearby rural
areas."
15
Disability: Physical disability
"For those who are disabled and
are seeking to get experience and
international exposure, my advice
is to move ahead and accept an
entry level job with a development
agency. It could be a turning point
in your life. The benefit you gain
from this experience is two fold ­ it
is enhancing both personally and
professionally. You become more
aware of your strengths and qualities
that in turn help you in dealing with
your status as a disabled person in
more positive ways. People also start
realizing your value, your potential as
a human being. On the career front,
you become more creative, more
dynamic in your approach to various
parameters that lead to success.
"One day my boss asked me to
conduct an interview for appointing
the program associates, who are
people at a higher level than mine. I
became apprehensive about what I
would ask them, given this situation.
I had never done this before, so
I was lacking confidence. But he
encouraged me with his wonderful
tips and guess what? It worked
out well and I ended up helping the
selection committee select the most
eligible and worthy candidates for our
organization."
Travel Opportunities
"I traveled to the United States to
participate in Mobility International
USA's (MIUSA) International
Women's Institute on Leadership and
Disability. Moreover, MIUSA sends
me information on international
internships, fellowships, funding
agencies, upcoming events and
seminars, which keeps me updated
with what is going on around
the world in the international
development field."
16
M
any people go into the fields
of international affairs,
development or exchange
to make a difference in the world or
explore other cultural perspectives.
Most have had previous international
experiences that made an impact
on their own life choices. Since
entry positions in these fields are
generally in the low to middle salary
range, most people entering the
international arena are attracted
to this field of work by motivations
other than money. International
travel will entice some people to
international careers, although
travel opportunities will vary with
positions. Some positions involve
administrative, research or policy
level work, while others entail direct
assistance, marketing or advising. As
they gain experience, professionals
in international fields can advance
to senior level positions and
responsibilities, with higher salary
levels.
For some people it is a chance
to fulfill personal aspirations, or
the lessons from and connections
with people in other countries that
motivate and benefit them.
"[An internship] in Costa Rica
increased my desire to enter the
international development field to
a fevered pitch. Partly this was
because I realized how much I loved
this work. Anything and everything
else would have seemed `second
best' in comparison. I realized that
finding a job in the international
development field would both let
me follow my passion and help me
manage my ADD because I was doing
what I loved."
Andrea Shettle, Deaf and attention
deficit disorder, Research Assistant at
the World Bank.
"I think the highlight for me is all the
people that I've met; I know I could
go back to these countries and these
people are like brothers and sisters.
I've traveled in Zimbabwe, and I have
a network of friends there, not only
on a personal level but professionally.
It gave me insight on what some of
the issues are that they are dealing
with. We tend to put everything
into perspective of our culture, and
when you start looking through their
eyes, you see a whole other kind of
dynamic."
Don Galloway, blind, former Peace
International Careers:
BenefitsandMotivations
"By far, being exposed to various cultures and seeing how genuine
people are from all around the world -- that's the beautiful thing about
international work."
Chris Emanuel, wheelchair user, works on international projects
at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
17
Corps country director in Jamaica.
The majority of people of color and
people with disabilities worldwide live
in developing countries. People with
disabilities and from different ethnic
backgrounds need to bring their
perspective and voice to international
development organizations and U.S.
government offices overseas, so this
segment of the population is included
and empowered to contribute to the
dialogue.
"Poverty is so great and the
resources are so absent in many
other countries. And it's a shame
that we can't share more....We
could have a much better world if we
worked to help everyone make their
full contributions to it. That's what
motivates me."
Deidre Davis, wheelchair user,
former Deputy Assistant Secretary for Equal
Opportunity and Civil Rights for the United
States Department of State.
"I showed Costa Rican deaf students
a photograph of a large group of deaf
adults, and explained, `He's deaf,
they're all deaf, all of these people
are deaf!' until they finally got it. They
were thunderstruck by seeing the faces
of so many deaf adults all at once.
This moment really brought home for
me the importance of bringing deaf
adult role models to deaf children
in developing countries ­it's not just
so they can see deaf adults being
successful but, more fundamentally, so
they really understand that deaf adults
do exist."
Andrea Shettle, Deaf and attention
deficit disorder, Research Assistant at
the World Bank.
18
T
he Association of Professional
Schools in International Affairs
reported that 88 percent of
2002 graduates in international
affairs found work within six months
after graduation, a competitive
placement rate in comparison to
professional degrees in law or
business. The largest percent of
graduates (42 percent) found work
in the public sector with about a
quarter each working in the nonprofit
and private sectors. Even in difficult
economic climates, international
affairs graduates can find exciting
careers because of the strength and
versatility of this type of degree.
For those looking for employment in
the public sector, many opportunities
exist. The U.S. Department of State's
Workforce Recruitment Program for
College Students with Disabilities
(www.careers.state.gov/state)
attracts and refers talented students
with disabilities to federal and private
sector organizations for temporary
and permanent employment.
"Because the Foreign Service
represents the incredible, wonderful
diversity of the United States and
all of its people, we are doing
everything we can to ensure that the
Foreign Service looks like America
as it goes about representing
America," notes Ambassador Ruth
Davis in a Georgetown University
School of Foreign Service report
(2003). Federal government entry
level positions for undergraduates
range from $28,000 to $36,000
salary levels, with extensive benefits
packages. Salary can double in five
to ten years with promotions.
"A lot more people with disabilities
and people of color need to get
involved in foreign affairs."
Deidre Davis, wheelchair user,
former Deputy Assistant Secretary for Equal
Opportunity and Civil Rights for the United
States Department of State.
International Careers:
FutureJobProspects
"As the Advisor on Disability and Development at the World Bank, we
are seeking to recruit interns, consultants and staff with disabilities.
International experience is critical to working in the international
development arena."
Judith Heumann, wheelchair user,
Advisor at the World Bank.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT
New job opportunities are also
opening in the non-profit sector.
Government support to international
development organizations are
expected to increase by $5 billion by
2006, adding to existing public funds
and additional billions from private
donors. Many important international
development agencies, such as Mercy
Corps and American Friends Service
Committee, seek out people with
skills and expertise to ensure that
their organizations meet the needs of
all people.
"After working in the international
field, I have realized that the world
for and of people with disabilities is
changing at a rapid pace. Increasing
consciousness of civil rights and
emergence of people with disabilities
in displaying skills and knowledge
to improve their own lives are some
of the factors that are contributing
to the new thinking that a disabled
person deserves a dignified status
in society on the same terms as a
non-disabled person. As a result of
this, more people from the NGO (non-
profit) sector and from the corporate
world have shown willingness
to [hire people with disabilities].
Therefore, I believe that someone
who is intelligent and creative with
innovative ideas and passion to
change the world for the better will
not be left out just on the grounds
of his or her disability. The world will
accept them ­ no doubt about that!"
Jyoti Vidhani, physical disability,
Material Resources Officer, Catholic Relief
Services, India.
INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGE
For people interested in working
specifically with international
exchange programs, the numbers of
college students studying abroad has
more than doubled (126 percent) in
the past decade (Open Doors Survey:
Institute of International Education,
2003). In addition, a Congressional
commission is looking at the
potential for increasing the numbers
of students studying, interning or
volunteering abroad for academic
credit from 160,000 to 500,000
students. The U.S. President also
proposed doubling the number of
Peace Corps volunteers by 2007. All
of this means more need for staff
to coordinate placements of these
exchange participants.
"I think the biggest success is
how far we've actually come in
terms of promoting international
education for everyone ­ for any
type of underrepresented population
­ including people with disabilities.
The outreach has been tremendous. I
think many universities are on board
­ not because they have to be, but
because they want to be. So in that
sense, I think there have been a lot
of successes."
Peter Kerrigan, vice president
of membership at the Forum on Education
Abroad (A World Awaits You, MIUSA 2002).

Doing very well in college and
obtaining a degree are important
steps to prepare for a career in
an international field. However,
participating in experiential activities
can make a significant difference in
making connections and building the
depth of experience necessary to
start an international career.
Most people with disabilities who are
employed in international work have
in common a history of participation
in international exchange.
INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGE
EXPERIENCES
Whether it is volunteering in Latin
America, taking a summer foreign
language course in Europe or
studying for a semester or year in
International Careers:
QualificationsandPreparations
Asia -- if you want to both have the
qualifications and find out if this type
of work fits and motivates you, then
an overseas program should be in
your plans. Research1
shows that an
international exchange experience
also has other benefits that affect
your work ­ increased self-confidence,
expanded worldview and improved
adaptability and language skills,
among others.

"I'm so much farther ahead of other students who are my age, have
a 4.0 grade point average, but do not have the experience I've had
through internships, study abroad, student activities and volunteering
in the community."
Alison LePage, learning disability,
student in Political Science at Western Michigan State University.
21
"My experience with American
Friends Service Committee in Pueblo,
Mexico crystallized that I wanted
to work in the developing world. It
was a tremendous introduction to
some of the issues and actors in the
international scene. Getting involved
in some kind of exchange to see if
an international experience is really
where your passion lies is a good
idea."
Alison Hillman, bi-polar disorder,
advocacy director at Mental Disability
Rights International.
"[When I applied for a social work
internship in Costa Rica] partly
I wanted to see if I really could
do this kind of work in a way that
would make a difference in the deaf
community where I worked, and if I
really would find it as enjoyable and
as rewarding as I hoped.... I found I
learned a great deal in the process
of preparing for the internship,
and then going to Costa Rica for
those 11 weeks. I gained a lot of
confidence in myself and my skills
in giving leadership training to up-
and-coming deaf leaders. And it was
tremendously rewarding."
Andrea Shettle, Deaf and attention
deficit disorder, student internship in
Costa Rica, employed currently at the
World Bank.
"As I look back, I truly think that my
studies and time in San Diego are
one of the best things that have ever
happened to me. The chance to study
abroad gave me invaluable academic
and professional opportunities
and, most importantly, provided
irreplaceable personal experiences."
Daniella Levy-Pinto, blind,
International Relations Major from Mexico.
"Peace Corps is an excellent
opportunity, and it opens a lot of
doors. You gain experience, you're
close to different cultures, and
it plays a very big role when you
are talking about résumé building.
Employers look at applications
and time after time they will take
the person with Peace Corps
experience."
Chris Emanuel, wheelchair user,
works on international projects at the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency.
"I found my job after I came back
to India from MIUSA's International
Women's Institute on Leadership and
Disability exchange program in the
United States. When Catholic Relief
Services saw my résumé, they were
quite impressed with it and that really
motivated them to consider hiring me."
Jyoti Vidhani, physical disability,
Material Resources (MR)/MIS officer,
Catholic Relief Services, India.
22
For those interested in working in
the study abroad field, a survey
of professionals indicated that
employers seeking to hire entry-level
study abroad program advisors view
extensive international exchange
experience as the most important
(41 percent) qualification, followed
by experience in an exchange
program office (34 percent) such as
a work-study position or internship
while in college (Robinson, 2003).
International exchange experience
is also ranked as most important
among qualifications for exchange
program representatives that travel
around the country promoting
programs, or overseas directors that
run the study abroad programs in
the host countries (Robinson, 2003).
The same is true for other careers in
international affairs or international
development.
"If you seriously want to enter the
international development field, then
I would strongly urge you to find some
way to do a long term internship,
job, volunteer position, or other
experience (Peace Corps, Volunteer
Service Organization, whatever
works) in a developing country.
Try to get at least two years total
under your belt, whether it's all at
once or in a few multi-month stints.
Many international development
organizations won't even look at your
résumé unless you have relatively
extensive experience doing actual
development work in a developing
country.
"But, if you're still not sure whether
you want to go into this field, or
if you can't afford a long-term
travel opportunity because of time,
money, or other constraints, short
trips abroad can still be worthwhile
learning experiences if you do them
right. Meet people who live locally
and get to know them, whether it's by
traveling with a friend who is already
familiar with the area or maybe
working with a local disability non-
governmental organization."
Andrea Shettle, Deaf and attention
deficit disorder, research assistant at
the World Bank.
The National Clearinghouse on
Disability and Exchange's book
Survival Strategies for Going Abroad:
A Guide for People with Disabilities
(2005) shares first-hand accounts
from people with disabilities who
have participated in international
exchanges and their strategies that
can help you in navigating places that
are unfamiliar.
23
OTHER USEFUL EXPERIENCES
Foreign Language Skills
More doors will open for you if you
are proficient in another language in
addition to English. The U.S.
government alone requires 34,000
employees with foreign language
skills, and American businesses
increasingly need internationally
experienced employees to compete
in a global economy and to manage a
culturally diverse workforce. (Alliance
for International Educational and
Cultural Exchange, 2003). Foreign
language skills are especially
important if your goal is to find a
position overseas, such as study
abroad resident director, coordinating
host country logistics for participants
while they are studying abroad.
If languages are not your strength,
you don't need to discount
international work as a potential
career option. Many jobs, particularly
U.S.-based administrative positions
for international organizations,
do not require foreign language
proficiency. However, your options for
employment and graduate programs
in international fields will be more
limited if you do not have skills in
English and another language.
Foreign Service Exam
"If international work is what you
are interested in, then you should
certainly seek out an international
non-profit organization, or apply to the
U.S. Department of State or another
international federal agency. There are
a lot of opportunities for international
work. Consider taking the Foreign
Service exam."
Chris Emanuel, wheelchair user,
international projects at the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency.
Those who are interested in working in
the Foreign Service must first take and
pass an exam that is conducted once
a year. Since it is competitive, there
are practice books and preparatory
courses that can prepare you for the
exam. To learn more about the exam,
and if this career is right for you, visit
the Foreign Service website at: www.
foreignservicecareers.gov.
24
Graduate Degrees
Entry-level positions in international
organizations require at least an
undergraduate degree. A master's
degree is often required for more
advanced positions, and doctorate
degrees are sometimes required
for executive level positions at
international offices. For individuals
interested in U.S. Foreign Service
work, a graduate degree is most
valuable (see the degree section later
to find out about graduate school
preparatory programs). The majority
of study abroad staff surveyed
reported that they had master's
degrees, although an undergraduate
degree was accepted as minimum
qualification for a program advisor
position at most of their institutions
(Robinson, 2003). Interestingly,
the level of degree held seemed to
be less important to those serving
overseas as resident directors or
traveling the country as an exchange
program representative.
Regarding field of study, International
Relations seemed to be the major
of most of the study abroad
professionals surveyed, although
the majority (70 percent) of their
positions did not specify a required
or preferred major (Roy Robinson,
2003). The U.S. Foreign Service also
accepts a wide array of degrees.
However, degrees that focus on
economics, international relations,
international or U.S. regional studies,
political science, or public affairs may
be helpful in preparing for the Foreign
Service exam.
"I am getting ready to [go on to
graduate school]. I'm looking at
Johns Hopkins University and/or
the Kennedy School at Harvard
University. I first wanted to become
very skilled at my position at the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency;
I am beginning my third year here.
They have a program that will allow
us to get our master's degree, so
that is my plan."
Chris Emanuel, wheelchair user,
undergraduate degree in International
Relations at University of Southern California.
25
Informational Interviews
Setting up short meetings to talk with
professionals about their careers,
both what motivates them and their
day to day tasks, can be helpful
in determining if such positions
would be right for you. Informational
interviews can also give you insight
into the paths that others have taken
toward a career that you might find
interesting.
"I would strongly encourage you
to pursue many `informational
interviews' with people who are
already doing the kind of work you
think you might want to do some day
and find out from them what degrees
and experiences they have, what
degrees their co-workers have, etc. If
you talk with people who make hiring
decisions you can also ask what
kind of academic, work, internship,
and volunteer experience they look
for in their potential employees.
Informational interviewing can be an
excellent way to gather information
that can help you figure out how to
plan your academic career."
Andrea Shettle, Deaf and attention
deficit disorder, research assistant at
the World Bank.
Skill and Confidence Building
Skills in interpersonal, intercultural
and diplomatic communication as
well as the ability to multi-task, think
analytically and use the computer are
often highly desirable qualifications.
Participating in courses or activities,
such as the Model United Nations
conferences or intercultural training
workshops, to practice and improve
on these skills can be helpful in
preparing for an international career.
"I believed in myself, my own
capabilities and potential. [I also
had] some ideas, a little bit of
empathy and a vision to create a
better and more equal society....
When you put all these qualities
together, you are fit for success in
this international field!"
Jyoti Vidhani, physical disability,
Material Resources Officer, Catholic Relief
Services, India
26
Internships
Many people with disabilities who
found jobs in the international
field first held internships to
gain valuable experience toward
their career goal. Visit college or
university career service offices or
contact organizations that interest
you directly to inquire if they have
internship opportunities available.
Some organizations that have
international internship programs
are listed in the Stepping Stones:
International Fellowship Programs in
College section later in this booklet.
"Take advantage of the various
internship programs that the U.S.
Department of State and other
federal departments and agencies
have to offer while you are in college.
There is an array of positions. Apply
and apply again; the competition is
stiff, so be qualified. Be willing to go
through it."
Deidre Davis, wheelchair user,
former Deputy Assistant Secretary for
Equal Opportunity and Civil Rights for the
Department of State.
"Get used to reading a world-
renowned newspaper every day (Wall
Street Journal, New York Times,
Washington Post, International Herald
Tribune, and other major newspapers
in other countries) and apply early
for internships. Knowledge will be
your most important asset starting
off, and an understanding of how the
world works combined with the skills
and personality to express opinions
can help you immensely when
starting out."
Josh Pila, hard of hearing,
former student intern at the Bureau of
Educational and Cultural Affairs of the U.S.
Department of State.
27
"Start with an internship is my
advice. Take advantage of the
interaction with staff. Take your
responsibilities to heart. If you are
a good worker you will gain respect
and open doors. Be open and
sincere; say `I want to learn!' When
I interned at Mobility International
USA, I realized that I had a
passion for cultures, international
communications, and negotiations.
The internship made me look into an
international studies major."
Ingrid Ioan, wheelchair user
from Romania, undergraduate student at the
University of Oregon in international studies.
"The summer internship with
Gallaudet University's Center for
Global Education gave me the
opportunity to set up a listserv
called deafintl. It put me in contact
with deaf people in developing
countries, which helped increase my
commitment to getting more actively
involved with affecting these issues. I
think another outcome of my summer
internship is that it increased my
motivation for finding a way to do a
social work internship abroad."
Andrea Shettle, Deaf and attention
deficit disorder, research assistant at
the World Bank
"I did summer internships at different
universities while in college in Atlanta,
Berkeley, and Middlebury, Vermont
with the Institute for International
Public Policy (IIPP) fellowship program
[see the later chapter on fellowships
to find out more]. I was in the very first
cohort of IIPP fellows. When I came
to Washington, DC to do a semester
program for my university, IIPP helped
me to land a job at the Organization
of Africans in the Americas, an Afro-
Latino organization. That job afforded
me the opportunity to go to Nicaragua
to facilitate a conference. We worked
closely with the United Nations, the
Interagency Development Bank and
Catholic charities to get supplies and
address the needs of communities of
color throughout Central and South
America."
Chris Emanuel, wheelchair user,
works on international projects at the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency.

Stepping Stones

A
s with non-disabled students,
young people with disabilities
must think about what
they want to do after high school.
Extracurricular or classroom activities
provide experiences that are often
invaluable in helping students
to decide on a career path. For
general information on transitioning
into future plans for youth with
disabilities, you can find resources
from the National Center on
Secondary Education and Transition
(www.ncset.org, 612-624-4512).
Following are examples of
international activities that are good
ways for you to explore international
interests and opportunities.
DISABILITY MENTORING AND JOB
SHADOWING DAYS
In February each year, the national
Job Shadow Day (www.jobshadow.org,
800-373-3174) kicks off a program
in which a million high school
students explore careers by being
matched with workplace mentors,
who over the year provide on the job
experiences that complement what
students learn in the classroom.
Each October, Disability Mentoring
Day (www.dmd-aapd.org, 800-840-
8844 tel/tty) is held worldwide and
locally, providing opportunities for
young people with disabilities to
gain skills and knowledge by being
mentored by someone working in
their field of interest. While these
events are not necessarily related
to the international field, you
can express your interests in an
international career and ask for a
mentoring site that lets you explore
that in more detail.
FOREIGN LANGUAGE OR
INTERNATIONAL SUMMER CAMPS
The younger you are, the easier
it may be to learn a language.
Check out local summer camps,
courses or clubs that allow you to
be immersed in a foreign language.
A general listing of foreign language
camps for youth can be found at the
Southwestern Opportunities Network
(www.swopnet.com/geo_rodeowriter_
2000/lang_camps.html, 512-327-
1310). Foreign languages will also
help you learn about other cultures
and perspectives. If you cannot find
a course, camp or club in your area,
find people in your community that
speak another language or check out
foreign language books and tapes
from the local library.
Stepping Stones:
InternationalActivitiesinHighSchool
"The Berlin Wall fell when I was in high school, and I had a world
history teacher who gave us global current events every single day
of class. I thought, `Wow, what an interesting time to be alive. How
wonderful if I could have a career affecting it in some way.'"
Sandra Sermons, blind,
master's degree in International Relations from American University.
31
Another option is to participate in
summer camps in the United States
with people from other countries,
such as Children's International
Summer Villages (www.cisvusa.
org, 888-247-8872), Volunteers for
Peace's international workcamps
(www.vfp.org, 802-259-2759) or
Interlochen's international summer
camp (www.interlochen.org, 231-276-
7200). Being surrounded by people
who speak other languages can be a
fun way to learn new vocabulary and
concepts.
An internationally focused summer
session for high school students can
be found at Georgetown University's
Special Programs (www.georgetown.
edu/ssce/spp/hsir.htm, 202-687-
5719). This Washington, DC one-
week workshop on international
relations includes small-group
discussions, site visits, and
lectures that introduce students
to the complexity of foreign policy
issues and teaches intercultural
empathy. The session can be a
good introduction to an international
career.
INTERNATIONAL STUDIES AND
FOREIGN LANGUAGE IMMERSION
SCHOOLS
The Asia Society (www.
internationaled.org/schools.htm,
212-327-9227) has created a
national network of urban secondary
schools in five U.S. cities devoted to
providing an education that includes
international studies for low-income
and minority students. This prepares
them for college and the working
world in an increasingly global
society.
"We must give all of our young
people access to the high-quality
education they need to succeed
in today's demanding economy,"
said Tom Vander Ark, director of
education for the Bill and Melinda
Gates Foundation that funded
the Asia Society schools. "These
students will leave high school with a
strong knowledge of other countries,
cultures and languages, and a strong
desire to keep learning, follow their
dreams and explore exciting career
paths."
32
Other internationally focused schools,
that are members of International
Studies School Association (www.
du.edu/issa) are available across the
United States from Illinois to Oregon
to Texas. Ask your local school
district if there is an international
high school in which you could
enroll. You can also take high school
classes to help prepare for an
international college degree.
If you are interested in schools that
teach in two languages, the Center
for Applied Linguistics (www.cal.
org/resources/earlyfl/; info@cal.org)
reports there are 248 such programs
in the United States, with the majority
being public schools teaching
Spanish and English.
MODEL UNITED NATIONS
Model United Nations (U.N.) (www.
un.org/cyberschoolbus) is an
authentic simulation of the U.N.
General Assembly and other
multilateral bodies, in which students
assume the role of ambassadors to
the U.N. at a Model U.N. event. More
than 200,000 high school students
participate either in classrooms in
their own high schools, or at larger
conferences with participants from
all over the United States and the
world. More than 400 conferences
take place in 35 countries each year.
Model U.N. conferences are held
virtually every month throughout the
school year, with fewer events in the
summer.
A Model U.N. event is a good first step
into international activities, as you
do not already have to know about
international relations. Anyone can
participate who has the ambition to
learn something new, and to work with
people to try to make a difference in
the world. The Model U.N. experience
promotes interest in international
relations, increases the capacity to
engage in problem solving, teaches
aspects of conflict resolution, research
skills and communication, and creates
an opportunity to meet new people
and make new friends.
ONLINE INTERNATIONAL LEARNING
EXCHANGES
Whether writing to a pen pal in another
country or participating in online
chats with students from around the
world, Internet-based experiences
can cultivate learning about different
cultural perspectives. An example of
this is International Education and
Resource Network (iEARN), a non-profit
organization made up of over 20,000
schools in more than 109 countries.
iEARN (www.iearn.org, 212-870-2693)
brings teachers and young people
together online using the Internet
and other new communications
technologies for students to engage in
educational projects with peers in their
countries and around the world. The
Canadian based E-PALS Classroom
Exchange (www.epals.com, 613-562-
9847) provides tools to translate
foreign languages online and matches
classrooms from different countries
for cultural exchange discussions.
33
The British Council's Windows on
the World website (www.wotw.org.
uk, 44-20-7389-4359) is also a free
resource to make school-to-school
connections worldwide.
Other international online resources
include those from Returned Peace
Corps Volunteers, who share
personal experiences and country
information with classrooms through
the following programs:
 World Wise Schools (www.
peacecorps.gov/wws, 800-424-
8580 ext. 1450)
 Global Teach Net (www.rpcv.org/
pages/globalteachnet.cfm, 202-
293-7728, ext. 11)
 One World, Our World (www.
members.cox.net/1wow_program,
800-910-5437).
Ask your teachers if they can help you
to become involved.
INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGE
PROGRAMS
Whether as a participant traveling
overseas for study, language
learning, volunteer or cultural
tours, or as a homestay family that
welcomes a high school student
from another country into your
home ­ international exchanges give
you real life experiences that can
influence your future interests and
qualifications. American Institute for
Foreign Study found that 86 percent
of alumni in its high school exchange
programs felt the experience was a
worthwhile investment in their future.
The programs described here both
bring high school students from
other countries to the United States
and send U.S. high school students
abroad for summer, semester or
academic year programs. Some
of these organizations may offer
scholarships to support participation
of individuals from underrepresented
groups, such as people with
disabilities, members of ethnic or
cultural minority groups, and people
from low-income backgrounds.
MIUSA's National Clearinghouse
on Disability and Exchange (www.
miusa.org, 541-343-1284 tel/tty)
can provide tips and resources to
assist you and the exchange program
staff to plan for disability-related

n order to work in international
affairs, development or exchange
fields, many people seek out an
international relations or studies
degree program, such as those
that are listed in this section. Many
programs are interdisciplinary in
nature and provide courses that can
be useful forvarious international
career paths. For undergraduate
programs, browse the college guides
and online databases, such as U.S.
News college rankings (www.usnews.
com) and Peterson's college guides
(http://iiswinprd01.petersons.com).
Thousands of options are available.
If you are ready for graduate school,
the Association of Professional
Schools in International Affairs (www.
apsia.org, 303-871-4021) found
3,000 students enrolled in 2003 in
the 29 U.S. graduate programs in
International Affairs, with 56 percent
women, 23 percent international
students, and 20 percent minority
students. A partial listing of these
schools follows, but visit the
APSIA website for a complete list
of its graduate school programs.
While one does not need to have
majored in International Relations
as an undergraduate, coursework in
economics and foreign languages is
sometimes required for entrance into
graduate programs.
To talk with admissions counselors
at various programs, both APSIA and
the Public Policy and International
Affairs program (www.ppiaprogram.
org, 202-496-0130) host free
graduate school expos in several
cities each fall. Also the following two
programs assist undergraduates that
are underrepresented in graduate
schools to prepare for successful
admissions to graduate school.

PPIA seven-week summer fellowships
prepare students, primarily from
historically underrepresented groups,
for graduate studies and careers in
public and/or international affairs.

community leaders who represent
the diverse backgrounds and
perspectives of their constituencies.
The program focuses on economics,
domestic/international policy
issues and leadership topics to
sharpen quantitative, analytic and
communication skills.
Fellowships include:
 Full tuition/board for PPIA Junior
Summer Policy Institute, plus
$1,000 stipend
 Minimum of $5,000 toward
graduate school tuition and waived
application fees at 41 consortium
schools
 Eligible for paid internships.
Eligibility
 Must demonstrate a commitment
to public service
 Economic need is given extra
consideration
 Any academic major is accepted
 United States citizen or permanent
resident
"The PPIA coordinator at UC- Berkeley
was very receptive. When my tape
recorder broke the second week of
the program, I wondered how I was
going to compete and keep up with
notes in the program. I explained to
the coordinator what I needed, as
well as extended time on tests, and
within 24 hours I got a tape recorder.
While I really appreciated this, when
that one didn't work out for what I
needed, they got me a second one
right away with higher quality. When
I reported that the handrails in my
bathroom weren't solid, within a
week they had someone in there
repairing it. This helped make the
PPIA program just beautiful ­ I still
keep in touch with the coordinator
today."

years following my undergraduate

related job as a political analyst at
the Mexican Institute for Political
Studies, where I worked for a few
years. It had always been a dream of
mine to live and attend a university
43
in another country, so I started
concentrating on graduate programs
in the United States and Canada.
I felt that such an opportunity
would not only be beneficial for my
career, but it would also enhance
my independence....I found myself
having to prepare, and eventually
take the Test of English as a Foreign
Language (TOEFL) and the Graduate
Record Examination (GRE). In order
for me to take these exams, I had
to obtain special accommodations,
such as a reader and extended test
time. Several weeks after submitting
my applications, I learned that I was
accepted into the Graduate School
of International Relations and Pacific
Studies (IR/PS) at the University of
California, San Diego. Obviously, this
was exciting news and it meant that I
was one step closer to achieving my
goal."

An interdisciplinary undergraduate
and master's degree program in
international studies is offered for
students who contemplate careers
in international affairs, international
development, diplomacy, international
organizations, or domestic
organizations with an international
focus. A minimum of 73 credits must
be completed for the degree. Areas
of professional concentration include
cross-cultural training, gender and
development, international education,
and public policy and planning.
Approximately half of the program's
graduate students are international
students.
"Choosing an international career
offered me a great opportunity to
expand my horizons and helped me
to make sense of our society and the
diversity of life. Being in International
Studies not only developed my

how to think critically and objectively

S
ince 1981 when Mobility
International USA (MIUSA)
began promoting the
importance of international exchange
to the disability community, MIUSA
has seen an increase in the numbers
of individuals with disabilities who
have gone on exchange programs.
However, there are still very few
people with disabilities working in
international career fields.
In order to encourage people with
disabilities to not only go on an
exchange, but to consider a career
in the field, MIUSA and the American
Association of People with Disabilities
(AAPD), under the auspice of the
National Clearinghouse on Disability
and Exchange, began a collaborative
project to promote internships
for people with disabilities at
international exchange organizations
in the United States. Internship
sites have included Partners
of the Americas and Youth for
Understanding USA in Washington,
DC, and locally based member
organizations of NAFSA: Association
of International Educators and
National Council for International
Visitors. Internships enabled
individuals to gain experience in the
international exchange field, and for
these organizations to gain disability
perspectives by hosting an intern
with a disability. Eight U.S. interns
with disabilities, many from minority
backgrounds, participated in recent
summers with support from the
Bureau of Educational and Cultural
Affairs of the U.S. Department of
State and hosting organizations.
"Serbia, Montenegro, Germany,
Finland, Peru, Hungary, Ghana
and Russia are just a few of the
countries that were represented by
international exchange visitors to
Kalamazoo, Michigan. Participating in
the internship program provided me
with an extraordinary opportunity to
meet fascinating people, expand my
knowledge of international relations
and intertwine disability awareness in
international exchanges.... I wrote a
grant, designed a website, presented
a proposal at a board meeting and
attended international education
conferences in Lincoln, Nebraska and

Other organizations' programs
provide a variety of opportunities
from preparatory courses to study
abroad to internships. Some of
these fellowships are primarily
for those from ethnic minority
backgrounds, while others specify
other requirements. Most offer
generous opportunities to gain
needed experience towards the goal
of working in international fields.
Alumni surveys consistently illustrate
that these fellowships have strong
effects on determining career paths.
Some do not focus specifically
on international experiences, but
fellows can request an international
component. Internships are
available in international non-profit
organizations or international
divisions of federal governmental
offices. While not common, students
have occasionally found permanent
positions in the organization in which
they interned.

overview of some of the
opportunities that can assist you to

"I worked with the Future Leaders
Exchange (FLEX) program and helped
facilitate a system of international
cultural exchange that makes a wide
impact on personal levels of all the
participants...I had just finished
grant paperwork at the office when
we had a visit from a group of FLEX
students [from Eurasia]. In that one
moment, the paperwork linked to
the human face and I could see the
effects of the American government's
international exchange programs and
see the fruits of my labor."
Josh Pila, hard of hearing,
student intern at Bureau of Educational
and Cultural Affairs of the United States

Stepping Stones:
TipsforEnteringYourCareer
"I kept trying to network with people in the field of international
development, partly by setting up informational interviews. One
of these informational interviews was at the World Bank. The
advisor looked at my résumé and suggested I contact someone in
the executive office here on a job opening she had for a research
assistant."
Andrea Shettle, Deaf and attention deficit disorder,
research assistant at the World Bank.
W
ith academic and
experiential preparation,
tips for finding a first job
in the international field are the
same as for other careers. If an
internship hasn't led you into a job,
then networking, practicing interviews
with friends or mentors, browsing job
search engines and classified ads,
posting résumés online, attending
employment fairs or conferences,
researching places of interest to you
and conducting informational inter-
views can all be valuable tools to help
you get into the field. Following are
suggestions and resources tailored to
job searches in the international arena.
CAREER WORKSHOPS AND EXPOS
The Public Policy and
International Affairs (PPIA)
Program (www.ppiaprogram.org,
202-496-0130) hosts free career
fairs in two cities each fall, in
which governmental and nonprofit
agencies exhibit. The PPIA fairs
offer opportunities to generate job
leads, and workshops featuring
young professionals and established
executives provide overviews of
particular fields in public service.
The Society for International
Development (www.sidw.org,
202-884-8590) holds an annual
Career Conference in Washington, DC
geared toward those just beginning
their careers in international
development, mid-level professionals
and foreign nationals. The Career
Conference includes panel discus-
sions, a recruitment area, networking
receptions and small group workshops.
Registration costs are minimal.
NAFSA: Association of
International Educators (www.
nafsa.org, 202-737-3699) includes a
job registry component at its annual
conference in which attendees can
submit résumés and interview with
study abroad, international student
services or related offices during the
conference. Attracting thousands
of professionals in the international
education field from the United States
and abroad, the NAFSA conference
also includes receptions for
networking, sessions for professional
development, and opportunities for
mentoring for newcomers to the field.
Students' fees are usually half the
regular cost.
64
"At my first national NAFSA
conference, I was encouraged
to meet so many individuals
dedicated to promoting intercultural
understanding. One important
aspect of the conference for me
was the Student Mentor Program.
My mentor, who is the coordinator
of study abroad and international
student services at a small liberal
arts college, offered me a lot of sage
advice concerning how to manage a
one-person office and how to market
my skills set."
Allegra Johnson, arthritis,
Master's student in International Education,
School for International Training, hired upon
graduation as a study abroad advisor for
Washington State University.
ALUMNI AND PROFESSIONAL
ASSOCIATIONS
The majority of available jobs are
never advertised, which is why
it is important to be involved in
professional circles that relate to
what you want to do. Professional
associations are great ways to
stay connected, making you more
privy to information about what
positions are open, and familiar to
potential employers. Professional
associations often offer newsletters,
listservs and annual conferences.
For international exchange, NAFSA:
Association of International
Educators has an active study
abroad listserv (SECUSS-L) that often
posts job openings. For international
development, InterAction (www.
interaction.org, 202-667-8227), an
organization of more than 160 US-
based international development and
relief agencies, publishes a bi-weekly
newsletter, Monday Developments,
which lists job postings.
Many graduate schools in
international affairs have active
student or alumni groups that can
provide professional development
opportunities. For example, the
International Development Program
Student Association at American
University brings professionals in the
field to its campus for forums that
are open to the public. American
University's School for International
Service runs an informative listserv
(owner-sisl@LISTSERV.AMERICAN.
EDU). For people who are interested
in international human rights, another
listserv that sometimes has job
postings is at (hr-professionals-
subscribe@derechos.net). Gallaudet
65
University has a listserv that is
focused on international development
(amy.wilson@gallaudet.edu), and the
Peace Corps (www.peacecorps.gov)
has excellent resource libraries and
networks on its website set up for
returned volunteers to find job leads.
"Institute of International Public
Policy (IIPP) had a reception in
Washington, DC, with people from
the U.S. Department of State,
the U.S. Department of Education
and others. It made for a great
networking session. We were there
to hear different speakers and to
catch up with other IIPP alumni at
the same time. It also provided a
beautiful opportunity to network,
especially if you had brought your
résumés, and I took advantage of
it. A woman that I didn't know came
up to me and eventually offered
me a job; I was just being polite
and answering questions. So when
I speak with IIPP students, I tell
them to be cognizant of how you
act and who you are talking to. You
never know who's watching you.
Always be professional. Have fun but
conduct yourself in a professional
way because you never know.
Things happen serendipitously. I am
speaking from my own experience."
Chris Emanuel, wheelchair user,
IIPP alumnus on finding his first job at the
Fulbright office.

When looking for jobs, Andrea Shettle
used the free online service, Change

com/monitor.html), to be notified of
changes in web pages. This helped
her keep track of new postings at
organizations that interested her. In
addition to using regular job search
engines, or looking for job postings
on websites of organizations where
you want to work, the following
Canadian and United Kingdom
websites have international job
postings: Escape Artist (www.
escapeartist.com/jobs/overseas1.
htm), and About Jobs (www.
overseasjobs.com).
"I would generally go through the
weekly employment newspaper that
publishes job vacancies in the local
area. Another powerful medium is the
Internet. We have a website, DevNet:
International Development Jobs and
Consultancies (www.devnetjobs.
org), that posts job requirements in
the international development field
on international and national levels.
I didn't have trouble finding a job in
the international field. I am affected
by polio in my lower limbs. However,
the selection committee trusted
my knowledge, experience, vision
and dedication for working for the
vulnerable and isolated groups in the
community."

Services, India.

CHANGING CAREER PATHS
Some people with disabilities find
themselves needing to retrain or
wanting to change careers later in
their lives, and many seek advice
on how to make inroads into the
international field. The interest in
the international arena comes from
having been affected by an exchange
experience in their former careers
or personal lives; for example,
a Fulbright scholarship to teach
overseas, an international conference
or an international volunteer
experience with a program, such
as Habitat for Humanity. Firsthand
international experience is often
an important step to making the

Individuals who are using vocational
rehabilitation funds in retraining
for a career can use these funds
to support study abroad as part of
a degree program. You can find a
brochure on how to continue Social
Security benefits and use vocational
rehabilitation funding while studying
abroad on MIUSA's website (www.
miusa.org) or contact the National
Clearinghouse on Disability and
Exchange at (541) 343-1284

Stepping Stones:
Mid-CareerTransitions
"I was incredulous that many deaf people, especially deaf women,
were kept in their homes away form their communities and that
they had never ever met other deaf people like themselves. Many
had never seen sign language before. I decided to quit my job and
volunteer in a developing country to work to help empower Deaf
communities."
Amy Wilson, professor at Gallaudet University.

"If you are trying to change careers,
then you may find it easier to
capitalize on the skills you already
have for working in an international
environment rather than to try to
move directly to a job that requires
the background, training, skills,
experience and preparation that you
don't yet have. Once you are in the
right kind of setting, you can gain
a lot of exposure to the field, and
build up a network of contacts that
may be able to lead you closer to
the kind of job you actually want in
this field.... For example, if you've
been doing computer programming or
web development, you might want to
start with computer-related work at
an international organization, even if
this isn't really the kind of work you
want to do. At the same time, you
may want to try pursuing a degree in
international development by taking
night classes, or pursuing fluency in
another language, or both. Once you
have an international organization
on your résumé, and a little more
training in the field you want, those
things may combine to get you closer
to your `dream job.'"
Andrea Shettle, Deaf and attention
deficit disorder, used her writing career
as entry into a research assistant position
at the World Bank.
ADVANCING IN THE
INTERNATIONAL FIELD
For those from underrepresented
backgrounds in the international field,
the path to advancement may seem
like a pioneering effort.
"As a person who is disabled I would
certainly investigate all my options.
Because it's not the easiest life in
terms of advancement in a career,
you've got to have a lot of nerve,
patience, fortitude and self-esteem."
Carol Dozeal, vision disability,
worked in private and governmental sectors
in the United States and abroad.

ore people with disabilities
are needed in the
international affairs,
development and exchange fields to
add their perspectives and voices
to international organizations and
diplomatic agencies and make
a difference by contributing to
worldwide issues. Newcomers to
the international field will need the
mentoring of those with disabilities
who have been in the field, and
who have successfully navigated
employment barriers.
Working in the international field
is not limited to working with
people with disabilities. Every time
businesses, communities and
cultures are exposed to people with
disabilities who are successful in
their work, their eyes are opened
to new possibilities, and doors are
opened for others with disabilities
in the future. Deidre Davis found
that when she went to work for the
U.S. Department of State visiting
embassies all over the world. Her
very presence made a difference in
accessibility. When her colleagues
saw how easy it was to make the
accommodations she needed, they
began to take the initiative to ensure
that they were made for others
too. They also began to think about
the ways in which their workplace
could be more accessible for future
employees with disabilities.
"I was able to educate the U.S.
Department of State to the fact
that they had to do more [targeted]
recruiting to get more people with
disabilities into the State Department
`family.' And that happened. It was
a slow and steady process. But
they did add people with disabilities
to their recruitment strategy
and established a reasonable
accommodation process. I think
that the Department is now a more
welcoming environment to people
with disabilities who are qualified for
civil service and the foreign service."
Deidre Davis, wheelchair user,
former Deputy Assistant Secretary for
Equal Opportunity and Civil Rights for the
U.S. Department of State.

"My belief system is a person with a disability shouldn't be hired to
just work with disabled organizations and on disabled issues. That
may be the first step, but we should branch out. And when people
like Judy [Heumann at the World Bank] are appointed to lead, they
can look back and say, `There are 100 people with disabilities now
working throughout this agency.' And that's the key of success to me
­ is to see how we bring in other brothers and sisters to work in all
capacities."
Don Galloway, blind,
former Peace Corps country director.

"If people with disabilities come
into the foreign service, I would say
it would be in their best interest
to talk to us so that they get a full
understanding of what they're going
to be facing. There are certain things
they should be made aware of."
Carol Doezal, vision disability,
chairperson of Disabled in Foreign Affairs
Agencies.
"When people you work with see the
challenges and the obstacles that
you will have to go through, they
will ask, `Why?' That's when they
will make the calls [to get changes
made]."
Chris Emanuel, wheelchair user
on his former employment at the Fulbright
office.
"I walk with a walker or use my
wheelchair (a scooter) to visit the
courts with the law students in
the first week. The Americans with
Disabilities Act is an eye-opener for
the students from other countries.
It's a good thing for them to see me
and see that just because I can't
walk, it doesn't impact me being able
to do the work I do."
Michele Shoresman, multiple
sclerosis, Assistant Dean of Graduate
and Joint Degree Programs at Washington
University School of Law working with study
abroad and international students.
Exchange offices can learn more
about recruiting and accommodating
participants with disabilities by
having more people with disabilities
on their staffs. As a supervisor of an
intern with a disability discovered:
"Our intern made great relationships
with visitors and resources around
our area. Her office and computer
knowledge has helped when we
have been short-handed. And most
importantly, she has taught everyone
in our office, including the board
members and me, the importance of
incorporating people with disabilities
in our international exchanges."
For those of you who take the
"stepping stones" to build your
qualifications for an international
career, you will benefit from the doors
these mentors have opened ahead
of you and pave the way for others to
follow.
"I would strongly recommend
that people with disabilities come
forward and spread their wings to
new horizons and new destinations
­ with insight and dedication not
only to improving their own life, but
also the lives of others in similar
conditions, seeking help and support
for change."

and access to opportunities and
networks necessary to enter
international development, affairs
and exchange careers.
We encourage you, and all people
with disabilities, to pursue your
international dreams, through study,
work, research, internship and
voluntary service. We believe that
international exchange can make
a difference for you, leading to
enhanced career opportunities, self-
discovery and a broader worldview.
We also believe that through
international involvement, you can
make a difference in the world. We
invite you to challenge yourself, and

"[An internship] in Costa Rica increased my desire to enter the
international development field to a fevered pitch. Partly this was
because I realized how much I loved this work.Anything and
everything else would have seemed `second best'in comparison.
I realized that finding a job in the international development field
would both let me follow my passion and help me manage my ADD
because I was doing what I loved."
