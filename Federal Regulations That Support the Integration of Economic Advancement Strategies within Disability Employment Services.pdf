Federal Regulations That Support the Integration of Economic
Advancement Strategies within Disability Employment Services
The following Federal regulations support the provision of economic advancement
strategies within disability services. Integrating economic advancement strategies into
disability services, such as employment planning, has demonstrated improved
employment outcomes and job retention for participants. As state level and community-
based organizations work to improve the employment and economic advancement of
their customers with disabilities, Federal regulations support integrated services and, in
some cases, mandate the provision of financial literacy and financial capability
strategies that ensure the economic self-sufficiency of individuals with disabilities.
WorkforceInnovationandOpportunityAct
The Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) provides guidance on the use of
state funds to provide financial literacy education activities as a mandated program
element for youth and as an allowable service for adults.
There are nine defined program elements in the Final Rule to describe financial literacy
education activities (Section 20CFR681.500):
1. Support the ability of participants to create budgets, initiate checking and savings
accounts at banks, and make informed financial decisions;
2. Support participants in learning how to effectively manage spending, credit, and
debt, including student loans, consumer credit, and credit cards;
3. Teach participants about the significance of credit reports and credit scores, what
their rights are regarding their credit and financial information, how to determine the
accuracy of a credit report and how to correct inaccuracies, and how to improve or
maintain good credit;
4. Support a participant's ability to understand, evaluate, and compare financial
products, services, and opportunities and to make informed financial decisions;
5. Educate participants about identity theft, ways to protect themselves from identify
theft, how to resolve cases of identity theft, and help them understand their rights
and protections related to personal identity and financial data;

6. Support activities that address the particular financial literacy needs of non-English
speakers, including providing support through the development and distribution of
multilingual financial literacy and education materials;
7. Support activities that address the particular financial literacy needs of youth with
disabilities, including connecting them to benefits planning and work incentives
counseling;
8. Provide financial education that is age-appropriate, timely, and provides
opportunities to put lessons into practice, such as access to safe and affordable
financial products that enable money management and savings; and
9. Implement other approaches to help participants gain the knowledge, skills, and
confidence to make informed financial decisions that enable them to attain greater
financial health and stability by using high quality, age-appropriate, and relevant
strategies and channels, including, where possible, timely and customized
information, guidance, tools, and instruction.
RehabilitationActof1973
The purpose of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 is to "empower individuals with disabilities
to maximize employment, economic self-sufficiency, independence, and inclusion
and integration into society."
The Rehabilitation Act mandates the provision of statewide comprehensive vocational
rehabilitation programs "designed to assess, plan, develop, and provide vocational
rehabilitation services for individuals with disabilities, consistent with their strengths,
resources, priorities, concerns, abilities, capabilities, interests, informed choice, and
economic self-sufficiency, so that such individuals may prepare for and engage in
gainful employment."
HomeandCommunity-BasedServicesFinalRule
The Home and Community-Based Services (HCBS) Final Rule ensures that individuals
receiving long-term care services and supports, through HCBS programs under the
1915(c), 1915(i) and 1915(k) Medicaid authorities, have full access to benefits of
community living and the opportunity to receive services in the most integrated setting
appropriate. The HCBS Final Rule requirements maximize opportunities for individuals
to have access to the benefits of community living and the opportunity to receive
services in the most integrated setting.
www.leadcenter.org
Two of the requirements within the HCBS Final Rule speak to an individual's financial
capability (their ability make informed financial decisions):
1. Provide opportunities to seek employment and work in competitive integrated
settings, engage in community life, and control personal resources; and
2. Optimize individual initiative, autonomy, and independence in making life
choices.
ApproachingIntegratedServices
The Health and Human Services, Administration of Children & Families, commissioned
Building Financial Capability: A Planning Guide for Integrated Services to guide
organizations through a multi-step process of developing an integration plan to provide
financial capability services. Organizations offering services for the first time, or
expanding existing services, can use the guide to determine which services to deliver
in-house, which to offer through referrals, and which to provide through partnerships.
National Disability Institute (NDI) offers trainings and toolkits to build the capacity of
organizations to provide financial literacy education that meets the unique needs of
people with disabilities. You can join NDI's Real Economic Impact Network to participate
in free monthly webinars featuring subject matter experts on financial education and
financial capability building strategies for individuals with disabilities, and to connect with
partners who are committed to supporting the financial capability of job seekers with
disabilities.
The Virginia Department for Aging and Rehabilitative Services (VA DARS) created a
webinar training series on addressing a major barrier to work ­ lack of financial
resources ­ as a component of their Career Pathways strategy. This webinar series,
facilitated by the LEAD Center, will equip current VA DARS staff, including Work
Incentives Specialist Advocates (WISAs) and other DARS staff and vendors, with the
education and resources necessary to build the financial capability of customers and
maximize their potential for long-term employment success.
